                    but at the same time it happens that there are some great pains and toils. 
                    For I will come to the bottom of it, no one should practice any kind of work unless he derives 
                    some benefit from it. He wants to be a hairless man, let him flee from pain. Unless they are 
                    blinded by desire, they do not come out, they are in fault who abandon their 
                    duties, that is, the soul softens."

                    accuse pleasure and praise pain, I will open the whole matter, and I will 
                    explain the very things which were said by that discoverer of truth and as it 
                    were the architect of a happy life. great pains follow those who do not know 
                    how to pursue pleasure. Nor is there anyone who wants to pursue pain because it
                    is pain, but because such times never occur that he seeks some great pleasure 
                    through labor and pain , who among us undertakes any physical exercise, except 
                    in order to derive some advantage from it? But who can rightly blame him who 
                    wants to be in that pleasure without suffering, or him who avoids pain from 
                    which no pleasure is produced?"

                    "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of ​​denouncing pleasure 
                    and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system
                    , and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
                    the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids 
                    pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how 
                    to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 
                    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of 
                    itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in 
                    which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial 
                    example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to 
                    obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man 
                    who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who 
                    avoids a pain that produces no resulting pleasure?"

                    "But indeed we both accuse and with just hatred bring those who deserve it 
                    who are softened and corrupted by the flattery of present pleasures, and who 
                    are blinded by lust for the pains and troubles they are about to experience, 
                    and do not provide for them; it is an easy and expedient distinction, for when 
                    we are free to choose and nothing prevents us from doing what pleases us the 
                    most, all pleasure must be repelled so that the pleasures are to be rejected 
                    and the pains not to be refused. Therefore the selection of these things is 
                    held by the wise, so that either by rejecting pleasures other things may be 
                    obtained or by enduring pains they may repel them."
